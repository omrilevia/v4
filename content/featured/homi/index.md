HoMi IoT is my Master's Project. Its inception stems from the desire to have devices connected to the internet, be remotely controllable, and easy to automate. HoMi IoT is an IoT platform that aims to tackle existing market issues with a universal, scalable plugin development framework. It implements a modular plugin based design around a system core.
